    <h2>Advantages of Working with a Criminal Defence Lawyer:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Navigate Penal Code with Ease</li>
            <p>
                The law is a very complicated matter and it cannot be navigated with ease if you are not a savyy. Granted, you might be able to understand
                certain topics at surface level, but it will take you way more than that in case of a criminal case. You will need someone that can understand 
                the almost foreign language of the law. A criminal defence lawyer is the person to give you that kind of support. They will be able to read 
                the details of you case and determine the best defence strategy that can work best for you to obtain a dismissal.
            </p>
        <li>Solve your case at Pretrial</li>
            <p>
                In most of criminal cases, a good criminal defense lawyer would be able to solve your case without having to visit the court. Working with a defence attorney
                would allow him to work on your case and solving it a <b>pretrial</b> by negotiating with the prosecution for a lighter sentence or negotiate a fine
                instead of jail time. 
            </p>
        <li>It Pays to Have Experience</li>
            <p>
                An experienced criminal defence lawyer would be able to look at your case if all the pilled up evidence has been obrained legally and in the 
                correct manner. In other terms, they would be able to know if they evidence has been presented and filed prior to the trial and that it can be 
                used in a criminal letigation. They will also be able to know how to go through the pile of paperwork the prosecution is presenting for your case.
                THey can also help identify legal expecations that can get the evidence thrown out. For instance, <b>former testimony</b> and <b>hearsay</b> are legal
                exceptions that can get evidence thrown out in a criminal trial.
            </p>
        <li>Keep a Clean Record</li>
            <p>
                A criminal defence lawyer can help you maintain your record clean and shoot for a dismissal, when applicable. If the charges against you or evidence are not enough
                as to have a strong case. You criminal lawyer would be able to handle the case by presenting strong evidence to the judge as to have a dismall of all charges.
                Defending yourself and hoping to get a dismissal is almost like shooting yourself in the foot. A criminal lawyer with the right knowledge can help you keep your name
                clean of criminal charges and avoid a criminal record.
                
            </p>
        <li>Avoid Unnecessary Trials</li>
            <p>
                As mentioned, criminal defence lawyers can know if your case is worth disputing at a court of law and in most of the cases, it is not. A white-collar crime 
                does not have the same weight as serious criminal infrictions such as first-degree murder or trafficking. Through expert negotiations with the prosecution, jail
                time can become a fine.
            </p>
    </ul>
